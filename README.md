## Diagnosis of reactant starvation of PEMFCs using machine learning

This project looks at diagnosing reactant starvation of PEMFCs. Multi-sine frequency optimisation was done in collaboration with Yash Patankar. Note that due to the number and total size of the raw data files it was not possible to upload raw data files, even as a zip format. Instead, the wrangled voltage signal data wa uploaded as `.npy` files. File paths in the Jupyter notebooks may need to be adjusted as appropriately.
